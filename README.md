###JRPG Project Platform Designer
This allows you to create your own stage in the game!

#How does it work?
-> Create a platform
-> Save the platform in "../JRPG-Solution/JRPG-Project/Stages"

> And that's it! The game will automatically read the file and create your stage.

#Designer Features:
 - Setting the amount of cells in a grid
 - Placing the tiles
 - Placing the player
 - Placing Lootboxes

#Nuances
- Rightclicking will remove the tile and place an "Empty Tile"
- To place whatever you want, you need to click on the "Pick" button next to your tool that you're using.
 
This app developes alongside the game itself.
